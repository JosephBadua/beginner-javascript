      Our Videos Set Us Apart.
      The truth is that interview questions and algorithms are difficult. Even more difficult is trying to understand the inner workings of a complex algorithm from a book or from a poorly thought-out video shot on your grandma's camera. Our crisp 1080p videos boast crystal-clear audio and are strategically divided into two parts to give you the most comprehensive explanations to questions. That's over 55 hours of content specifically tailored to make interview questions and algorithms easy.

      Conceptual Overview
      Our videos all start with an in-depth conceptual overview of the algorithm at hand: how to approach it, how to implement it, how to optimize it, and how to analyze its space-time complexity. See an example.

      Code Walkthrough
      Our videos all end with a complete walkthrough from start to finish of the actual code implementation of the algorithm. This is done in Python, since Python is very easy to read. See an example.

      Data Structures Crash Course
      Algorithms and data structures go hand in hand; the solution to virtually any coding interview problem will require the implementation of some kind of abstract data type in order to access and manipulate information.

      Our video series on data structures is the ultimate crash course on this important topic. We cover fundamental concepts pertaining to memory, complexity analysis, and Big O notation, and then break down popular data structures to give you a detailed look at how these concepts are applied under the hood. Linked Lists and Binary Trees will never instill fear in your heart again.

      We Speak 7 Languages.
      There's nothing more frustrating than opening an interview prep book, only to find a bunch of solutions in a programming language that you don't know. That's why all of our questions come with complete written solutions in 7 popular languages.

      JavaScript, for all you Web Developers
      Python, for all you Data Scientists
      Swift, for all you iOS Engineers
      C++, for all you Old Schoolers

      Hey there! Do you want to ace your upcoming tech interviews?|
      Of course!
      Nope.

      The Perfect Practice Environment.
      In an ideal world, you would prepare for tech interviews by coding out solutions to problems in your language of choice, getting some hints if necessary, running your code against test cases, and looking at solutions when done. We've turned that ideal world into the real world. Pick a language. Read the prompt. Write your solution. Get some hints. Run your code. Check the output. Pass the tests. View our solution. All within the same workspace.

      Note: this is a sample workspace. Any work done on this page will not actually be saved, even if you are logged in.


      Big O Notation Made Easy.
      Time Complexity
      Why does building a heap only take O(N) time? What does O(logN) really mean? What's the time-complexity difference between appending a value to an array and adding a character to a string? We address all of these things, and more.

      Space Complexity
      You know that thing you're kinda familiar with but not really? Yeah, that's space complexity. And it turns out it's pretty important. All of our video explanations dive deep into space-complexity to turn you into a well rounded Big O expert.
